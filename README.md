Sudoku game written in Python with the Pygame library 
6
to visualize the backtracking algorithm.

​
8
Every time the program is executed, a solvable board is created
9
and the user can attempt to solve it by clicking on the cells.
10
Entering a number into a cell will be entered as a tentative value. 
11
This will commence a visual that demonstrates how the backtracking algorithm
12
is being applied in order to solve the board.
