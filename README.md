# Sudoku-Solver

![PyGame][1] ![Python][2]


Sudoku game written in Python with the Pygame library 

to visualize the backtracking algorithm. 

Every time the program is executed, a solvable board is created

and the user can attempt to solve it by clicking on the cells.

Entering a number into a cell will be entered as a tentative value. 

This will commence a visual that demonstrates how the backtracking algorithm

is being applied in order to solve the board.

In order to run the program, the following is required:

* Python 3 

* Pygame

â€‹

Pygame can simply be installed from the command prompt by

running `pip install pygame` *or* `py -3.4 -m pip install pygame`

where `-3.4` should be replaced with your current version of Python. Alternatively,

you could download Pygame directly from their website (check the link under this project's About).

## Downloading and running

After downloading and extracting the zip from the [releases][6] page, double

click on `main.py` to run the program. Alternatively, open it from an

IDE of choice.
